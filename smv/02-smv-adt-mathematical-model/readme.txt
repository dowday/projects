Abstract Data Type is a mathematical model for data, known as ADT, where a data type is
defined by its behavior (semantics).
To understand ADT, lets take two steps back, If we take off Abstract and Data from ADT, now
we have type, and a type would be defined as a collection of type values, e.g., integer type,
0, 1, 2 etc.
If we add the Data back in we would define data type as a type and the set of operations that
will manipulate the type, e.g., addition, subtraction, and multiplication are operations that
can be performed on the integer data type.
So, we can define an abstract data type (ADT) as a data type, that is a type and the set
of operations 4 that will manipulate the type, e.g., for the integer data type, the operations
might be delete an integer, add an integer, print an integer, and check to see if a certain integer
exists.

In this work, we will create ADT to define oriented graphs, i.e., directed graph is an ordered
pair G = (V, A) with
• V a set whose elements are called vertices, nodes, or points ;
• A a set of ordered pairs of vertices, called arrows, directed edges (sometimes simply
edges with the corresponding set named E instead of A), directed arcs, or directed lines.
To do this, we will use an eclipse plugin called ALPiNA, i.e., Algebraic Petri Nets Analyzer
and is a model checker for Algebraic Petri Nets. And with the rewriting tool in ALPiNA we
will check with our solution that all the theorems defined in graph.adt are validated. So, we
will construct graph.adt file by replacing the *** with the adequate expressions.
