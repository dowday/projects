\section*{Introduction}

In this TP we will implement the PSO algorithm to learn the weights of a Neural Netwrok model to classify hand written digit, so we are talking about pattern recognition.


PSO utilizes a very simplified model of social behavior to solve the optimization problems, in a cooperative and intelligent framework. PSO is one of the most useful and famous metaheuristics and it is successfully applied to various optimization problems.\\ \\

\textit{\textbf{Note}} :In the code you will see that all parameters are described very well in a comment.
